      * The computer will assign a random bot opponent for you to play against.
2.  **The Toss:**
      * Choose "Odd" or "Even".
      * Select a number from 1 to 6. The computer will also choose a number.
      * If the sum of the numbers matches your choice (e.g., you chose "Even" and the sum is 4), you win the toss\!
      * If you win the toss, you can choose to **Bat** or **Bowl**.
3.  **Batting:**
      * Your goal is to score as many runs as possible.
      * Choose a number from 1 to 6 by clicking the buttons.
      * If your chosen number is **different** from the computer's number, your number is added to your score.
      * If your chosen number is the **same** as the computer's, you are **OUT\!**
4.  **Bowling:**
      * Your goal is to get the computer out before it reaches the target score.
      * Choose a number from 1 to 6.
      * If the computer's number is **different** from yours, its number is added to its score.
      * If the computer's number is the **same** as yours, the computer is **OUT\!**
5.  **Winning the Game:**
      * **If you bat first:** You win if you get the computer out before it scores more runs than you.
      * **If you bowl first:** You win if you score more runs than the computer's target before getting out.
      * **If the scores are tied** after both teams have played, the match proceeds to a **Super Over**\!
6.  **The Super Over (Tie-Breaker):**
      * Each team gets to bat for one over (6 balls).
      * The team that batted second in the main match will bat first in the Super Over.
      * The team that scores more runs in their 6 balls wins the entire match\!
